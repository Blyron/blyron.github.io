            <p>I am a usual person in this world, who likes to participate in team projects and team activities.</p>
            <p>
              Since i can remember i always have been in teams in order to get biggeer achivments than an individual can get in his own way.
              I could say that I am a person who needs people around me to get the best possible results.

            <p>
              I am a spanish programmer studying in Sheffield Hallam University, England. Before that I developed Old Town Stories (Oculus Rift, PC, Steam) during my studies on ESAT.
              During my studies I have gained experience developing for PC and mobile across multiple disciplines, though I feel most comfortable in core programming and physics related gameplay programming.
              I always want to learn from the people around me and grow as a coder and person to be able to be a better version of myself every day.
              That's why I always try to surround myself with the best people possible, work as well as possible and grow, especially grow.

              My passion for physics is real,
              If I had not been a programmer I would have studied physics, it is something that has always attracted me and always attracted me
