              <p>I am a usual person in this world, who likes to participate in team projects and team activities.</p>
              <p>
                Since i can remember i always have been in teams in order to get biggeer achivments than an individual can get in his own way.
                I could say that I am a person who needs people around me to get the best possible results.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am a spanish programmer studying in Sheffield Hallam University, England. Before that I developed Old Town Stories(Oculus Rift, PC, Steam) during my studies on ESAT.
                During my studies I have gained experience developing for PC and mobile across multiple disciplines, though I feel most comfortable in core programming and physics related gameplay programming.
                I always want to learn from the people around me and grow as a coder and person to be able to be a better version of myself every day.
                That's why I always try to surround myself with the best people possible, work as well as possible and grow, especially grow.

                My passion for physics is real,
                If I had not been a programmer I would have studied physics, it is something that has always attracted me and always attracted me

                During my last year on ESAT Valencia, i was assigned to a great team with very talented programmers and artist, and we developed this demo as a final year project.
                Old Town Stories is the main project of my portfolio, OTS is a VR game which belongs to wave shooter genre.
                I worked in this project as Core, Debug and Optimization programmer. It´s avalibable on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1120850/Old_Town_Stories/">Steam </a><br />
                Here you can find a list of some features i developed in it.

                  During the last year on ESAT we also were requested to make a component oriented 3D Engine, my partner <a href="https://raimundoma98.wordpress.com/">Jose Maria Raimundo</a> and I made this little engine. While Jose Maria made core things,
                  such as a Multithreading, Scripting or Model Loading, i made the render pipeline of the engine and render related things. I wanted to reach the point to get PBR pipeline but due to Old Town Stories
                  i did not achieve that. It is a big "TODO" for me, develop on my own PBR Engine. Meanwhile you can find a little video demo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAmMTDsgNYo&feature=youtu.be">here</a>.

                Given my pleasure for physics and maths i decided to make a little project in order to make something fun for me.

                  During the last year on ESAT we were requested to make a videogame similar to Minotaur Maze. The player will have to hunt the npcs while they are trying to find the exit door.
                  So i made it and i developed entirely the logic of the game using experimental features of UE4 such as "Enviorment Query System", also i made the animacion logic and implemented
                  a basic "Inverse Kinematics" logic for players character´s foots. <br />

                  During second year on ESAT, my partner and I developed a little Unity game for mobile and we published it. It´s an endless runner were you have to collect teseracts while avoiding asteroids.
